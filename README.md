# Defence_against_Gradient_Inversion_Attack
- This repository contains code for gradient inversion attack and novel potential defence 
- One approarch is using simple Auto encoder to generate images which have semantic features useful for classification but different from original images
- Other approach using adversarial training based approach Discriminator is siamesnetwork and generator is simple autoencoder.

## Progress
- full working code is in complete_code folder, this repository will be update to make code more modular
