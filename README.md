# Defence_against_Gradient_Inversion_Attack
- This repository contains code for gradient inversion attack and novel potential defence 
- One defence approach is using a simple Autoencoder to generate images which have semantic features useful for classification but different from original images
- Another defence approach using an adversarial training-based approach, Discriminator is siamesnetwork and generator is a simple autoencoder.

## Progress
- full working code is in complete_code folder, this repository will be updated to make code more modular
